# ForceCalculator
Demonstrates charge interactions and calculates force between two charges. 

Takes user inputs of charges (in coulombs) and radius (in meters), and outputs the forces (in newtons) experienced by each charge. Accompanying diagram demonstrates magnitude of charges, radius, and direction of forces.
